# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly). Users (once signed up) will be able to paste in accurate "long URL's" and transform them into "short URL's"  which were created using a base 62 URL shortening technique. Users can then copy this short url and add it to their tweets, easily share with their friends and whatever else that they would like to do! For example https://www.imdb.com/ becomes .../u/Wgi0VU.
